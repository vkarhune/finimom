title: "Non-local priors"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Here is an example of a non-local prior:

```{r setup}
library(finimom)

curve(dimom(x, tau = 0.0083, r = 1, phi = 1), -0.8, 0.8, xlab = bquote(beta), ylab = "Density")


```

The choice of $\tau$ parameter is based on the suggestion in Sanyal et al. (2019).
We can obtain the corresponding quantile from the relation of the inverse-moment prior with the (inverse) Gamma distribution:

```{r invgamma}

betaq <- 0.05
prob <- 0.01

qgamma(1 - prob, shape = 0.5, scale = 1)*betaq^2

```


Session info:

```{r sessioninfo}

sessionInfo()

```
